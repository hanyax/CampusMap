# This test if the graph can have multiple different edge between two points

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node A to graph1

# Add edges
added edge AC from A to B in graph1
added edge AD from A to B in graph1
added edge AA from A to B in graph1
added edge AA from A to C in graph1
added edge AE from A to A in graph1
added edge AZ from A to R in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: A B C R
the children of A in graph1 are: A(AE) B(AA) B(AC) B(AD) C(AA) R(AZ)
