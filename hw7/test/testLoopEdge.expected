# The Test tests multiple edges forming a close loop

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge 0.100 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge 0.200 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge 0.300 from n3 to n4 in graph1
added edge 0.400 from n4 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(0.100)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(0.200)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n4(0.300)
the children of n4 in graph1 are: n1(0.400)
