Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

	1) I changed the key of my inner map from label to the childNode of edges so that i can look for
	   connection between two nodes by calling the containsKey method which is much more efficient.
	   
	2) I canceled the data representation of GraphNode Instead, I simple use String to represent parentNodes, 
	   inner Map to represent Edge which key is childNode and value is HashSet of Edges
	   
	3) Since I canceled GraphNode, the representation of nodes in DirectedLabeledEdge is changed from
	   GraphNode object to String 
	   
	4) Implement comparable in the Edge in order to sort Edge lexicographically
