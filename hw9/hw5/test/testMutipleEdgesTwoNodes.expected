# This test if the graph can have multiple different edge between two points 

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e4 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2 
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2) n2(e3) n2(e4)
