# This test test if the edge can have a the same parentNode and childrenNode

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n2(e2)
