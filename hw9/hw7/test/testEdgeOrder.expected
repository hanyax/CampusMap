# This test test if the edge can have a the same parentNode and childrenNode

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge 0.000 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge 0.700 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge 0.400 from n1 to n1 in graph1
added edge 0.800 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(0.000) n1(0.400) n1(0.700) n1(0.800)
