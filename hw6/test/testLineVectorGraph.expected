# This test tests the Graph structor of a line where node were
# all linked with unique edge and formed a line vector

created graph test

added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in test
added edge e1 from n2 to n1 in test
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in test
added edge e2 from n3 to n2 in test
added edge e3 from n3 to n4 in test
added edge e3 from n4 to n3 in test

path from n1 to n4:
